These projects were done by me while I was learning my first programming language in college to better understand the topics taught in class. 

Some of these games are made with python and html and some with only python. 

for the games that just have a python file, inorder to run these games you just need python 3.9 that's what i am using currently.

on the other hand for the games that have a html page you can play the game by just running the index.html page.
